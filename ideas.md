## Basics

### Transformations

* Zoom
* Pan
* Rotate (90° offsets)
* Flip

## Comparison tools

Ideas for back to back image comparison

* Preserve zoom level/pan offset, so same size images can be swapped between without shifting
* Somehow allow re-ordering of images to allow quick toggling through several images to compare them all

# Inspection tools

Nice histogram

## HDR Support

* Load .hdr and .exr images
* Dynamic range scaling controls, log transform
* Panoramic mapping/viewing?


## Image sequence support?

Maybe, djv_view already does a good job of this for most things, though HDR image sequence viewing would be welcome.


## All the Formats

* everything supported by freeimage
* heic
* avif
* apng
* we'll have to see about video formats, seems kind of out of scope but if we're doing animated formats anyway..
* ¡ M I D I !
